Dealing with Numerical Data Analysis ,it was part of Shiraz University Advanced Database Course and its Assignments
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

this was a good Assignment for Advanced DB Course , Shiraz Univesity Fall 2021.
Exercise description:
Write a program that reads the data set file and does the following:

- Calculate the average value for each characteristic. Note that the output of this query is four in size, with each element averaging one of the characteristics of the data set.
- Calculate the covariance matrix for the properties.
- Which characteristic has the highest amount of variance and which characteristic has the least amount of variance? Print these attributes and their variance value in the output.
- Which two characteristics have the highest amount of covariance and which two characteristics have the lowest amount of covariance? Print these properties and their amount of covariance in the output.
- Calculate the correlation between the features using the cosine similarity relation. To calculate the correlation using cosine similarity, first subtract the attribute values ​​from their mean (which you calculated in response to question one) to obtain the centered values ​​for each characteristic, then calculate the cosine similarity between the resulting characteristic values. Print in the output and draw a dot diagram for the values ​​of the two most correlated characteristics.
- The density function graph of statistical distributions can be plotted by having their parameters. Suppose the values ​​of the second characteristic, the width of the normal distribution
follow. Extract the required parameters of the normal distribution from this characteristic and the distribution diagram
Draw the corresponding normal.
- Suppose sample number 18 has a missing value in one of its attributes and its width value is unknown:
(168, __, 7.6, 0.73, apple) Suggest a solution to fill this missing value in the dataset. Explain the reason for choosing your solution
Give.
